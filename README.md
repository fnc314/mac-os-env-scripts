# mac-os-env-scripts

Convenient scripts for `bash` or `zsh` terminals, used on MacOS

## About

This repo houses safe-to-share (and relatively generalized) configuration files to bootstrap the `ZSH`-driven `MacOS` `Terminal` application.  The `setup.zsh` file should handle all that is necessary.

```zsh
> setup.zsh
```
